# Harness Foundation â€” Intake

## One-liner
Establish deterministic, offline-first scaffolding, schemas, and CI gates for the evaluation harness.

## Scope
- Global governance and intake assets
- Schemas, minimal CI validation, deterministic project defaults

## Out-of-scope
- Probe generators, scorers, runtime code (later milestones)

## Dependencies
- GitHub Actions availability
- Node toolchain in CI jobs

## Acceptance criteria
- All 9 intake files present and validated in CI
- CI succeeds on markdown, yaml, schema, and mermaid checks
