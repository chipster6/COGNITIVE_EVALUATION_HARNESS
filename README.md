# Cognitive Pillars Evaluation Harness

Public repository. See `docs/lifecycle/0-intake/repo_description.md` for scope.

## Summary

Production-ready, local-first evaluation harness for LLMs measuring 21 cognitive pillars with deterministic, offline scoring. Strict JSON I/O, seeded synthetic data, single-attempt repair, bootstrap 95% CIs, reliability (KR-20/α), latency, composite scores, and CI validation.

## Full Description

Production-ready, local-first evaluation harness for LLMs that measures 21 cognitive pillars with deterministic, offline scoring. Enforces strict JSON I/O, seeded synthetic data, single-attempt repair, and uncertainty via bootstrap 95% CIs. Reports reliability (KR-20/α), latency, and composite scores; includes probe generators, schemas, scorers, and CI to validate artifacts. Targets reproducible, auditable model audits without network egress.
